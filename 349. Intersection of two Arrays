Intuition
The most straightforward way to find common elements between two lists is to compare every element of the first list against every element of the second list.

We start with an empty result list.

We iterate through nums1. For each number, we scan through all of nums2.

If a match is found, we add the number to our result list.

This initial process will result in a list containing all common elements, but with potentially many duplicates (e.g., if nums1={2, 2} and nums2={2, 2}, the result will be {2, 2, 2, 2}).

To satisfy the requirement that the intersection must contain only unique elements, we use a standard sequence of operations: Sort the result, then use std::unique to move all unique elements to the front, and finally erase the remaining duplicates.

Approach
Brute-Force Comparison (Nested Loops)
The first phase uses nested loops to find all common elements:
The outer loop iterates through nums1 (from index i=0 to N−1).
The inner loop iterates through nums2 (from index j=0 to M−1).
If nums1[i] == nums2[j], the element is added to the result vector.

Post-Processing to Handle UniquenessThe second phase cleans up the result vector to ensure only unique elements remain:

sort(result.begin(), result.end()): This places identical elements adjacently, which is a prerequisite for the std::unique function.

unique(result.begin(), result.end()): This function shifts unique elements to the front of the range and returns an iterator (last_unique) pointing to the element immediately following the sequence of unique elements. The section of the vector from last_unique to the end contains the now-redundant duplicate values.

result.erase(last_unique, result.end()): This removes the duplicate elements from the end of the vector.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(N*M + R /log R)

Where N is length of nums1

and M is length of nums2

and R is the size of result vector

Space complexity: O(R)


class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersection(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        vector<int> result;
        for(int i=0;i<nums1.size();i++){
            for(int j=0;j<nums2.size();j++){
                if(nums1[i]==nums2[j]){
                    result.push_back(nums1[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        sort(result.begin(),result.end());
        auto last_unique=unique(result.begin(),result.end());
        result.erase(last_unique,result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
