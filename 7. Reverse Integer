i have initialized a variable reversedint which we will use to store our required answer, we will run a while loop until out number is not equal to 0 and use %10 to extract the last digit every time and then add that extracted digit to
reversedint variable by multiplying it by 10.. also we have to check the overflow/ underflow condition inside while loop.

Overflow = if the number is greater than INT_MAX/10 then multiplying this number by 10 and adding it to digit will excced MAX_INT this is know as OVERFLOW CONDITION..
Underflow = same as overflow just check if the number is less than INT_MIN then it will cause underflow condition..  




class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        int reversedint=0;

        while(x!=0){
            int digit = x%10;
            if((reversedint>INT_MAX/10) || (reversedint<INT_MIN/10)){
                return 0;
            }

            reversedint= reversedint*10+digit;
            x=x/10;
        }
        return reversedint;
    }
};
